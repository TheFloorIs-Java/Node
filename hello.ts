/*
Typescript transpiles to javascript.
Transpiling is the act of converting one high-level programming language
to another high-level programming language, whereas compiling converts
a high-level language into a low-level language.

High level: easily readable by humans, contains useful abstractions like
memory management etc. (java, javascript, etc)
Low level: easily readably by machines, because it does away with abstractions
(machine code, assembly)

*/

/*
Also introduced by TS: strong types, interfaces (which are contracts that guarantee behavior, such as guaranteeing that data follows a certain format.)
also: access modifiers (just like in java), decorators (just like annotations in java)
